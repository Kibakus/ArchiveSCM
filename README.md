# About
This is the source repository for the **Archive SCM** plugin for Jenkins.
This plugin provides an additional SCM option to Jenkins, based on the zip archive.

# Purpose and Use Cases

Use this plugin if you want to use the Jenkins SCM (source code management)
functionality, but instead of retrieving code from a version control system such
as CVS, Subversion or git, instead retrieve the code from a zip archive.

You have a working code, and you put it in a repository to commit the source code (for example, Nexus).
The plugin allows you to deliver the source code.
